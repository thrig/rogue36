(this was traditional in Dungeons \&& Dragons) and can be improved by
wearing heavier armors or via enchantments.

.Ss Options
These can be set via the
.Ev ROGUEOPTS
environment variable or in-game with the
.Cm o
command.
.Pp
The
.Cm o
command places the cursor by the value of the first option and waits for
you to type. You can type a RETURN which means to go to the next option,
a 
.Cm \&-
which means to go to the previous option, an ESCAPE which means to
return to the game, or you can give the option a value. For boolean
options this merely involves pressing
.Cm t
for true or
.Cm f
for false. For string options, type the new value followed by a RETURN.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm askme , Cm noaskme
After reading a scroll or quaffing a potion that does not self identify
upon use,
.Nm
will ask you what to name it so you can recognize it in the future.
.It Cm file Ns = Ns Ar filename
Where the game should be saved to.
.Nm
may automatically save the game in this file under certain conditions.
The file name may contain the special character "~" which expands to
your home directory.
.It Cm flush , Cm noflush
If flush is set, all typeahead is thrown away after each round of
battle. This is useful for those who type way ahead and watch to their
dismay as a Kobold kills them.
.It Cm fruit Ns = Ns Ar fruit-name
This should hold the name of a fruit that you enjoy eating, such as a
snozzcumber. It is basically a whimsy that the program uses in a couple
of places.
.It Cm jump , Cm nojump
If this option is set, running moves will not be displayed until you
reach the end of the move. This saves considerable CPU time and display
time. This option defaults to on if you are using a slow terminal.

This is the name of your character. It is used if you get on the top ten
list. It must be less than 80 characters long.
.It Cm step , Cm nostep
When set lists of things, like inventories or
.Qq *
responses to

questions, are displayed one item at a time on the top of the screen,
rather than clearing the screen, displaying the list, then re-displaying
the dungeon level.
.It Cm terse , Cm noterse
Useful for those who are tired of the sometimes lengthy messages. This
is a useful option for those on slow terminals. This option defaults to
on if your are on a slow (under 1200 baud) terminal.

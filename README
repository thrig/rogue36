rogue3.6.3-src.tar.gz from somewhere, I forget where. this is mostly for
historical interest; the code has been modified to compile on Mac OS X
10.11 with gcc from the vendor or MacPorts with no errors (for me) via

    make

assuming the development tools and whatnot are installed (or also on
OpenBSD 6.3 with egcc)

see rogue36.html for docs on the game. to launch (assuming it compiled
without error):

    ./rogue36
